This project is concentrating on the use of numpy.random

First thing I need to do is to find a project and do some research on the statistics associated with it.  
The first thought I had was about the trip to school and how the time it takes can vary depending on traffic, season, weather day of the week etc.

But I was then thinking about how the landscape of jobs has changed.  
There is no longer a job for life, no longer staying in the same company for years on end.
How long do people typically stay in a job and what factors influence their choice to change jobs.  
My initial thoughts on influences are salary, position, qualification, boss, commute distance/time and family.

I will go to gov.ie, newspapers and job websites to see if there is useful information gathered in job employment surveys.
